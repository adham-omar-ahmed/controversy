		<h1> why do we play </h1>
        <p>An entire generation of adults grew up on computers and smartphones. Even for those who didnâ€™t, video games have become a natural part of their lives and their childrenâ€™s lives. Games are uniquely able to connect us: to entertain while inspiring teamwork, cooperation and sometimes a little competition. Itâ€™s not about who you are, but how you playâ€“and, as our research shows, anyone can play.

So, whatâ€™s driving us to play video games? The vast majority of players say video games provide mental stimulation (80 percent) and relaxation (79 percent). Video games help to connect us, and 65 percent of players say they play with others online or in person.</p>

<h1> Finding the right balance </h1>
<p>From education to family game night, parents know that video games have a positive impact on their lives and their families. Our research shows that parents are using video games to connect with their kidsâ€“and have a lot of fun along the way. In fact, more than half of parents (55 percent) say they play games with their children at least once a week, and 92 percent pay attention to the games their child plays.</P>
